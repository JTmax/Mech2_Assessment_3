Inspiration 

The inspiration for our project is twofold; prevalently we can establish a broader human appreciation and pastime in drinking tea. From an aid in conversation to a morning wake-up, tea has become a part of everyday life for many across the world, each with their own preferences and nuances. Our inspiration herein lies to create a device that can simplify this aspect of daily life, to automate the process of making a cup of tea. Such that it benefits the user with an exactly perfect and consistent cup of tea, improving the drinking experience. Furthermore, this project can provide tea to those not able to independently do so. Specifically, those with Parkinsonâ€™s disease, Essential Tremor, or related illnesses that prevent them from partaking in this basic everyday aspect. Consequently, the project endeavours to create a device that can locate a cup of water, brew a tea bag, pour milk, dispense sugar and stir; thus, producing a cup of tea.
